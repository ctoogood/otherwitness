## The Need for Arms Control

 Approximately $100 billion worth of arms is transferred between nations every year, a figure that has been steadily increasing over the past decade. Few international laws have existed governing the sale of arms between nations resulting in arms deals being approved with scant concern about the arms being used for human rights violations.  

 The Saudi-led coalition has used arms supplied by the US and the UK(as well as other suppliers)in numerous attacks on civilians in Yemen.

>**"Of the twenty-seven Saudi/UAE-led Coalition attacks documented in this report, weapons remnants indicating that a US-made weapon was likely involved were found in twenty-five cases and weapons remnants indicating that a UK-made weapon was likely involved were found in five cases."**[^1]

 And despite the full knowledge of such atrocities, both countries have continued approving arms deals to the coalition.

 It is political, economic and industrial motives that are often prioritised over the human cost. In defence of such deals, governments often cite a disputed fact[^2] that arms deals are crucial to the economy and employment.

 Concerned about the evidence of arms being used against humanitarian law, and the potential for more, there have been calls for a global treaty on arms trade for many years.

## The Arms Trade Treaty

 In 2014 the UN passed such a historic Arms Trade Treaty. Applauded by many who hoped that this would make a landmark shift in the legal trade of global arms.

 Before the treaty was enacted weapons could easily be attained by governments & armed groups with the intent to cause mass suffering. Governments who willingly sold weapons to such buyers could not be held accountable under international law.

> **“The Arms Trade Treaty requires all states-parties to adopt basic regulations and approval processes for the flow of weapons across international borders, establishes common international standards that must be met before arms exports are authorized, and requires annual reporting of imports and exports to a treaty secretariat”**[^3]

 More specifically through the standards and reporting required, the treaty hopes to help assess whether arms could be used in contravention of international humanitarian law. And to then consider means to avoid such uses.

 Following the enactment of the arms trade treaty in 2014, little seems to have changed. Many nations have been reluctant to ratify their commitment to the treaty, and even those that have signed the treaty are interpreting its meaning in very concerning ways.

> **“The Arms Trade Treaty promised to save countless lives by reigning in this massive, secretive industry, but at the moment weak implementation and a lack of transparency are threatening to undermine it."** *James Lynch, Head of Arms Control and Human Rights at Amnesty International*

 Arms supplied to Saudi Arabia, one of the largest importers of weapons globally in 2019, are being used prolifically in war crimes against the Yemeni population. Weapons supplied to Myanmar are fuelling a globally condemned rampage against the Rohingya.  Egypt, where a crackdown by the government is seeing many human rights abuses, is receiving arms from the UK, France and Italy. In 2017 the UK approved arms deals with 18 out of 30 countries that were included on a government list of countries where human rights are a concern.

 And with the US now decided to pull out of the arms trade treaty what hope is left for arms control?

## The Future of Arms Control

 Unless nations are willing to prioritise human rights over economic and political intentions, sales of arms to nations with human rights concerns will never cease.  The arms trade treaty is unfortunately still in its infancy, but there is still hope that such an agreement could help curb sales to those in violation of humanitarian law. Public, NGOs and the media must maintain pressure on their governments to restrict arms deals where there could be an unlawful human cost.
