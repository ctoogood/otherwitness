 Warships, fighter jets, tanks, guided missiles, machine guns, rifles; the global trade in such weapons is colossal.  Demand for weapons is high, as is the willingness for governments & manufacturers to profit from arms sales.  Around $100 billion is spent annually on international arms deals, but the biggest price surrounding the trade is the cost to human life.

 Since 1989 there have been around 2.7 million deaths during armed conflicts. A large proportion of which are civilian casualties. And despite such a staggering amount spent on the weapons used to fuel conflict, only a small percentage in comparison is spent on peacekeeping efforts.

 Little concern appears to be had within the world of the arms trade, as countries continue to make deals where weapons will undoubtedly end up contributing to the abuse of human rights and the continuation of conflicts.  Countries highlighted as having human rights concerns still receive arms export licence approvals time and time again.

 An article in the *Journal of Peace Research* indicates that arms imports increase the likelihood of conflict where preconditions of instability already exist[^1]

>**"While arms imports are not a genuine cause of intrastate conflicts, they significantly increase the probability of an onset in countries where conditions are notoriously conducive to conflict. In such situations, arms are not an effective deterrent but rather spark conflict escalation."** *Oliver Pamp, Journal of Peace Research*

## The Arms Trade & The Yemen Civil War

 The current civil war in Yemen is an astonishing case of persistence by nations to continue the flow of weapons into a conflict that has seen a plenitude of human rights abuses and a catastrophe of human suffering.  

 According to the UN, the civilian death toll in the Yemeni civil war sits at around 7000 but estimates from local NGOs are much higher. The number of those in need of humanitarian assistance is around 24 million, 10 million of which rely completely on food aid[^2].

 The sale of arms to parties involved in the conflict is a large contributing factor in the continuation of a conflict that has seen a multitude of human rights abuses.

> **” There is a clear risk that arms sales contribute to human rights violations, there are clear violations being committed by all sides. But in general, the more weapons get supplied, the more they risk being used”** *Oliver Feely-Sprague, Arms Trade Expert at Amnesty International*

 A report published by Oxfam revealed that the UK government has made more than £6.2bn worth of arms sales to the coalition fighting in Yemen since 2014. The £770m which Britain has contributed in aid to Yemen within the same period seems abysmal in comparison.  This approach to the conflict is described by campaigners as 'completely incoherent'.[^3]

> **“I think, as things stand today, history will judge us as an appalling failure of British foreign policy.”** *Andrew Mitchell MP – UK Conservative Former International Development Secretary*

### Responsibility for War Crimes

 Despite claiming to only attack areas where the Houthi rebels are situated, there have been documented cases of coalition strikes on funerals, weddings, hospitals and schools. The Houthi rebels are also known to commit atrocities of equal calibre but Saudi-led coalition airstrikes, using weapons from suppliers such as the UK and the US, are the main cause of child casualties and overall civilian casualties.[^4]

 The responsibility lies not only with the coalition but also with the nations that are continuing to supply the arms.

> **“Under international law, being a party to a conflict means providing military, financial or logistical support that directly degrades the military capacity of another belligerent and weakens their ability to conduct hostilities.”** *Arron Merat, The Guardian*

 Despite denying that they are contributing to any form of human rights violations in Yemen, the UK appears to be very closely entwined with the Saudi-led military. Channel 4’s *Dispatches* found that British contractors are present in Saudi military bases and are providing huge logistical support through training Saudi pilots, managing armouries, distributing weapons, managing radar systems and maintaining aircraft. As of this year, BAE reports that it has 6300 employees working in Saudi Arabia.  Contractors who had worked for BAE told *Dispatches* that if it wasn't for their presence Saudi Arabia wouldn't be able to continue their military campaign.[^5]

### Persistence to Sell

 International NGOs and investigative news organisations have found evidence to show that, under international humanitarian law, war crimes have been committed in Yemen.  Yet despite the widespread dissemination of these findings, governments continue to approve the supply weapons to fuel this conflict.
 Some countries within the EU, including Germany, have discontinued selling weapons to Saudi Arabia. However, nations such as the UK, France and the US will not willingly cease trading arms with the Saudi-led coalition despite repeated calls from the public and NGOs to do so.

## Fuelling Conflict

 The sale of arms globally on such a prolific level is an overwhelming factor in human rights violations throughout the world.  The economic gains of arms sales should be no comparison to the damage they cause to human life.  Greater accountability for governments and arms manufacturers is needed as well as a more regulated and documented arms trade.
