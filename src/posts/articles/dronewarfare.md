 # Drone Warfare

 It can be hard to imagine living in an area where there is a constant threat of attack from the skies - being overwhelmed by anxiety whenever an approaching hum can be heard. The prolific and rapidly increasing use of unmanned aerial vehicles(drones) has however created a reality like this for many - turning the entire planet into a potential battlefield. Despite claims that drones are highly precise in their targeting, there have been reports that more than 32% of those killed in drone strikes are civilians[^1]. And many of those killed are children.

**The civilian death toll and physical damage from armed drone attacks is colossal, but how else does it affect the lives of civilians?**

# Drone Warfare & Mental Health

 PTSD and forms of anticipatory anxiety are reported to be the most prevalent forms of mental illnesses as a result of drone strikes. Witnessing, surviving or having friends or relatives die in an attack have been known to cause long term psychological trauma.

> “Interviews with Pakistani health professionals similarly indicate that patients -particularly those who are later found to have been victims or had relatives who were victims of drone strikes-exhibit high rates of posttraumatic stress symptoms and various psychosomatic complaints associated with actual strikes and apprehension of future attacks.”[^2]

 As drones are used far more for surveillance than for attacks, they can be flying over certain areas almost constantly for extended periods. Just knowing the deadliness of one of these machines and then having one flying overhead would instil great fear. But over an extended time, this fear can become highly damaging. 

> “everyone is scared all the time.  When we’re sitting together to have a  meeting, we’re scared there might be a strike.  When you can hear the drone circling in the sky, you think it might strike you.  We’re always scared.  We always have this fear in our head .”[^3]

 This constant fear of drone strikes has been known to cause anticipatory anxiety in many. Those who experience it have been known to also have nightmares or trouble sleeping, loss of appetite, irritability and increased reactions to noises.

 Children are found to be most acutely affected by the presence of drones. Many experience nightmares, they fear going to school or even leaving their house. A child shouldn’t have to experience this kind of fear in their everyday life. Such fears and trauma can be further exacerbated by the loss of friends or relatives in drone attacks. Some children even witness such deaths, an event that would be sure to have a lasting mental effect on anyone for a lifetime. 

 It’s a terrifying thought to, especially as a child, have machines constantly circling overhead that could kill you or your family at any time. 

# Arms Control & Accountability

 Lacking transparency and legal justification for these killings, drone attacks have been classed as violating international humanitarian law[^4]. States need to ensure their deployment of these weapons respects international human rights. With such a high rate of civilian casualty and widespread trauma, a big change in the unfettered use of drones is required.
