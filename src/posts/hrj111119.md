## Bride Trafficking, China

>**"In China, the percentage of women has fallen steadily since 1987. Researchers estimate that China now has 30 to 40 million “missing women,” an imbalance caused by a preference for boys and exacerbated by the “one-child policy,” in place from 1979 to 2015, and ongoing restrictions on women’s reproductive rights. This gender gap has made it difficult for many Chinese men to find wives and has fueled a demand for trafficked women from abroad."** Heather Barr, HRW

## Civilian Casualties, Afghanistan

>**"As musicians started playing, Saleh sat next to them to enjoy the feast. But his joy was short-lived: the numerous guests included a suicide attacker claiming allegiance to the Islamic State who detonated a bomb. That was the end of the wedding, as well as Saleh's life. He was thirteen."

> "Given that nearly half of Afghanistan’s population is under 15, children have been affected the most by the ongoing war: suicide or car bombing, drones, night raids, widespread ground combat have all killed countless Afghans in large numbers."** *Ezzatullah Mehrdad, Global Voices*
